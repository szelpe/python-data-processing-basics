<h2>Customer Segmentation</h2>
<p>To better understand the effectiveness of the marketing campaign, we first segment the customers based on their product purchases. This allows us to determine which products were more popular among customers.</p>

</ul>
<p>From the above segmentation, it can be observed that Product A had the highest number of purchases, followed by Product C and Product B.</p>
<h2>Purchase Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li>Product A: Total purchase amount = $491.44</li>
<li>Product B: Total purchase amount = $290.49</li>
<li>Product C: Total purchase amount = $630.25</li>

<h2>Performance Analysis</h2>
<p>The performance of the marketing campaign can be assessed by analyzing the number of purchases and the revenue generated. Based on the data, the following insights can be derived:</p>
